CQRS allows the read and write operations to be scaled independently, since they are handled by separate models. This means that read-heavy applications can be scaled more easily without impacting the write operations, and vice versa.

🎯 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲
By optimizing each model for its specific use case, CQRS can lead to significant performance improvements. The Query model can be designed for fast data retrieval, while the Command model can be optimized for consistency and durability.
