𝗖𝗤𝗥𝗦 : 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

🎯 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
CQRS allows the read and write operations to be scaled independently, since they are handled by separate models. This means that read-heavy applications can be scaled more easily without impacting the write operations, and vice versa.

🎯 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲
By optimizing each model for its specific use case, CQRS can lead to significant performance improvements. The Query model can be designed for fast data retrieval, while the Command model can be optimized for consistency and durability.

🎯 𝗦𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀
CQRS provides a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain. Developers can more easily reason about how changes to the codebase will affect the overall system.
