𝗖𝗤𝗥𝗦 : 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

🎯 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
CQRS allows the read and write operations to be scaled independently, since they are handled by separate models. This means that read-heavy applications can be scaled more easily without impacting the write operations, and vice versa.

🎯 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲
By optimizing each model for its specific use case, CQRS can lead to significant performance improvements. The Query model can be designed for fast data retrieval, while the Command model can be optimized for consistency and durability.

🎯 𝗦𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀
CQRS provides a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain. Developers can more easily reason about how changes to the codebase will affect the overall system.

🎯 𝗙𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
CQRS allows each model to evolve independently, since they are not tightly coupled. This means that changes to one model can be made without impacting the other model.

⚠️ 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆
CQRS can increase the complexity of the application, since there are now two distinct models to maintain. This can lead to a steeper learning curve for developers and a more complex codebase overall.

⚠️ 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆
Since the Command and Query models are separate, there may be a delay between when data is written and when it becomes available for reading. This delay is known as eventual consistency and must be accounted for in the application design.
